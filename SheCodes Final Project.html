    <p>
      Thousands of years ago, humanity began looking at the sky and mapping the stars and then using them to locate,
      move and
      explore the waters, discovering new lands and civilizations. Observing the sky, people noticed that some events
      were
      repeated as some patterns were repeated in the sky. Science, religion, mysticism, there was no clear division
      between
      them. Years passed, science developed ðŸ¤© and a few years ago Astronomy - which is the science that studies the
      stars
      - broke away from Astrology - which is an interpretation of how planetary motions can influence life on Earth.
      I know that Astrology is not science, but a matter of belief and it was very difficult for me to accept this
      believing
      side of me. Using astrology I get to know myself better, I learned to deal with people in a much more open way and
      I can
      understand some needs of the ones around me just by looking at their birth chart. I can say that I am more
      tolerant,
      more empathetic with myself and with others after I started to study and understand astrology.
      It is common to hear that people do not identify with their sign, or that it is not possible for everyone born
      between
      May 21 and June 20 to have the same characteristics ðŸ¤”. Indeed, it is not possible, we are all different. The
      purpose
      of
      astrology is not to make everyone equal, but to understand the peculiarities of each one using the <em>Birth
        chart</em> for
      this.
      Let's start with the <strong>basics</strong>, what is your Sun Sign?
